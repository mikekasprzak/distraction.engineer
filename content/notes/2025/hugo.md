## Overview and History

The first CMS I used for blogging was WordPress. I started blogging in 2005 at <https://toonormal.com>. Too Normal/TooNormal/TOONormal was a pun on [Too Human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Human), an at-the-time AAA game that was stuck in development hell.

As of 2025, my blogging workflow is the following:

* CMS: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a popular "static site generator"
* Editor: Visual Studio Code with the Front Matter VSCode plugin

I briefly used Hugo

. Before that, and for a number of projects (<https://ludumdare.com>, .

To be honest, I don't necessarily like the way [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) does things. To Hugo's credit it is extremely flexible, but [Zola](https://getzola.org).
