This is a simple soup inspired by my mother's recipe.


## Tools

* stock pot (or other large pot)
* stove-top
* large spoon or silicone spatula

## Ingredients

### Dry

A chunky mirepoix.

* 2 medium onions, chopped
* 1 whole celery, chopped `(~4 cups)`
* 4 regular carrots, chopped

### Wet

* 6 cups of water

### Herbs and seasoning

* 4 tablespoons chicken or artificial chicken soup mix (primary salt)
* 3 tablespoons dry parsley
* `[optional]` Black pepper
* `[optional]` MSG
* `[optional]` Chopped fresh dill

### Starch (pick one)

* 4 large potatoes, chopped
* noodles
* rice

### While cooking

* oil (for sauteing)
* salt (to season vegetables while sauteing)
* a liquid, such as white wine, vodka, or water (for deglazing)

## Instructions

1. Add oil to pot, and set heat to medium-high.
   > You can test if the pot is hot enough by dropping a single vegetable into the pot. If it sizzles, it's ready
2. Add onions, a bit of salt, and saute them for a few minutes
3. Deglaze the pot by adding a small glug of liquid to an exposed dark spot on the pan and stirring the onions over it. The onions will pick up a light caramel color as you do this.
4. Add the remaining vegetables and saute for a few more minutes.
5. Once you're done "having fun" sauteing, add the water, the herbs, and the seasoning.
6. Once the broth is sufficiently seasoned (salty), add the starch.
7. Let everything simmer. Its finished once the starch is cooked (20-30 minutes)

### Variation: Cream of Potato

1. Prepare the soup as before with potato but use half the recommended amount of potato
2. Turn off heat, and let it cool.
  * It doesn't need to be room temperature, but cool enough that you're comfortable pouring, and it wont overheat your blender.
3. Pour soup into blender, and blend.
